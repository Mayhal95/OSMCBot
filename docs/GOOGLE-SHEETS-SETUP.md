# Google Sheets database setup

The OSMC bot uses the [OSMC | Main](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WaAwMsCw5wA1vXklryjri8CIri5gxJxoRc60jWAbj3A/edit) workbook as its source of truth.

## 1. Create a Google service account

1. Open [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
2. Create or select a project for the OSMC bot.
3. Enable the **Google Sheets API**.
4. Open **IAM & Admin → Service Accounts** and create a service account.
5. Open the service account, create a JSON key, and download it.

The downloaded key is a secret. Never commit it or upload it to Discord.

## 2. Add the credentials to `.env`

Copy the service account's `client_email` and `private_key` values into the local `.env` file:

```env
GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_EMAIL=osmc-bot@example-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com
GOOGLE_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\n...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n"
GOOGLE_SPREADSHEET_ID=1WaAwMsCw5wA1vXklryjri8CIri5gxJxoRc60jWAbj3A
```

Keep the private key in quotes and retain the literal `\n` sequences.

## 3. Share and unprotect the workbook

1. Share the workbook with the service account email as an **Editor**.
2. In Google Sheets, open **Data → Protect sheets and ranges**.
3. Remove protection from the blank `Sheet1` tab, or allow the service account to edit it.

The current workbook rejected schema creation because the connected account could not edit the protected tab.

## 4. Create the database schema

Run:

```powershell
npm run database:setup
```

This safely creates and formats these tabs without overwriting a conflicting header row:

- `Members` — member identity, in-game name, rank, status, and automatically captured dates
- `Ranks` — rank names mapped to Discord Role IDs
- `Member Notes` — private staff notes
- `Audit Log` — registration, edits, removals, notes, and roster-sync history

## 5. Configure rank synchronization

In the `Ranks` tab, add one row for each club rank:

| Rank         | Level | Discord Role ID           | Active | Notes    |
| ------------ | ----: | ------------------------- | ------ | -------- |
| Example Rank |     1 | Paste the Discord role ID | TRUE   | Optional |

The rank text must match the member's Rank value. `/roster sync` only manages roles listed here and leaves all unrelated Discord roles untouched.
