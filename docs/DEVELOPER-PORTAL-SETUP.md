# Discord Developer Portal setup

The project is ready before a Discord application exists. Complete these steps when you are ready to connect it.

## 1. Create the application

1. Open the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
2. Select **New Application** and name it `OSMC`.
3. On **General Information**, upload `assets/branding/osmc-logo.png` as the application icon.
4. Copy the **Application ID** into `DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` in `.env`.

## 2. Configure the bot

1. Open the **Bot** page for the application.
2. Set the username and upload the OSMC logo if Discord does not reuse the application icon.
3. Create or reset the token, then copy it into `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env`.
4. Leave privileged gateway intents disabled for now. The foundation only needs the standard Guilds intent.

Treat the token like a password. If it is ever posted, streamed, or committed, reset it immediately.

## 3. Install it in the development server

1. Open **Installation** in the Developer Portal.
2. Enable the `applications.commands` and `bot` scopes for a guild install.
3. Grant only these initial bot permissions:
   - View Channels
   - Send Messages
   - Attach Files
   - Manage Roles (required for `/roster sync`)
4. Use the generated installation link and select the development Discord server.

The permissions can be expanded later when a feature genuinely requires them.

## 4. Add the development server ID

1. In Discord, enable **Developer Mode** under **User Settings → Advanced**.
2. Right-click the development server and choose **Copy Server ID**.
3. Paste it into `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` in `.env`.

Guild command registration updates quickly and is best for development. When the bot is ready for wider use, remove `DISCORD_GUILD_ID` and run the deploy command again to register commands globally.

## 5. Register and run

```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
npm install
npm run database:setup
npm run commands:deploy
npm run dev
```

The bot should log in, report the registered commands, and expose the `/about`, `/member`, `/ping`, and `/roster` command groups in the server.
