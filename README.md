# OSMC Discord Bot

The official Discord bot foundation for the **Obsidian Serpents Motorcycle Club** in NoKey FiveM.

The bot is built with TypeScript, discord.js, and Discord Components V2. Every user-facing bot response uses the shared OSMC visual system:

- Primary: `#2A213A`
- Secondary: `#000000`
- Club mark: `assets/branding/osmc-logo.png`

## Requirements

- Node.js 22.12 or newer
- A Discord application and bot token
- A Discord server where you can install the bot

## First-time setup

Follow [the Developer Portal setup guide](docs/DEVELOPER-PORTAL-SETUP.md) and [Google Sheets setup guide](docs/GOOGLE-SHEETS-SETUP.md), then:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`.
2. Add the Discord and Google service account credentials.
3. Install dependencies with `npm install`.
4. Prepare the database tabs with `npm run database:setup`.
5. Register the slash commands with `npm run commands:deploy`.
6. Start the development bot with `npm run dev`.

Never commit `.env` or share the bot token.

## Commands included

Every command and management control is restricted to the Discord role configured by `OSMC_FOUNDER_ROLE_ID`. Ballot buttons are intentionally available to server members after a Founder opens a vote.

- `/about` — Displays the club identity and initial bot information.
- `/church` — Opens the private church console for attendance, discussion topics, and final meeting minutes with an automatic discussion thread.
- `/member register` — Registers an in-game name and automatically captures Discord identity and join dates.
- `/member view` — Displays a member profile.
- `/member edit` — Uses controlled rank/status dropdowns, synchronizes mapped Discord rank roles, or permanently deletes a member and their private notes after confirmation; every change is audited.
- `/member notes` — Views or adds private staff notes.
- `/ping` — Confirms that the bot and Discord connection are healthy.
- `/roster view` — Displays the paginated active roster.
- `/roster sync` — Previews and synchronizes configured Discord rank roles.
- `/vote` — Opens a 15- or 30-second ballot in the configured vote channel and publishes the final result with progress bars.

Church topics, final minutes, and votes are routed through `OSMC_CHURCH_TOPICS_CHANNEL_ID`, `OSMC_CHURCH_MINUTES_CHANNEL_ID`, and `OSMC_VOTES_CHANNEL_ID`. The supplied defaults point to the official OSMC channels.

## Components V2 standard

New features should build responses with the helpers in `src/ui`. Do not add legacy embeds or plain message responses. Centralizing the layout keeps the purple accent, typography, spacing, and error states consistent across the bot.
